    <h1>Player Application General Information</h1>
    NACCS Power Pugs Season 3 is a cutting-edge competitive queue that mirrors structured team league play through unprecedented innovation. Only the best of the best in the collegiate scene is permitted into this rigorous queue on an exclusive invite and application basis. <br><br>

    Every player will be required to sign a legally binding contract; authorized in-game leaders will be required to sign an additional legally binding contract. I recommend thoroughly reading each contract you sign; for all you know, you could be signing your life away to NACCS.  <br><br>
    
    Accepted applicants will be held legally responsible for the entirety of their signed contract(s). If you are not willing to accept this level of accountability and legal responsibility then do not apply. <br><br>
